Heya fellows,

<p align="justify">
When i switched from windows to linux 
I used whitespaces within folder/file names. But when switching to linux i this is not good pravtice due to the command line.
AT our luck the autocomplete capabilities add \ before the whitespaces to prevent being recognized as 2 args. but still, this seemed to me a nice task to create a tool which converts all files containg whites
</p>

So, lets build such a command line tool using Pythons standard library `argparse`!

- show some aspects of argparse
- how to store settings permamently within an app: .init files
- github action workflow, how to publish easily to pypi.org
-> interessantes reinbringen!
