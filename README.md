This blog is all about Cheminformatics, Linux, Python and everything I'm interested in. I wrote some tutorials, did some interesting data analysis and other stuff I wanna share with you. My aim is to add knowledge to the web, which bothered me didn't exist before. I hope you can find something you like :smiley:
